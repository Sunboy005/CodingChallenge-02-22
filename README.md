# HENRY NEEDS HELP AT SPARK PLUGS WEB DESIGN AGENCY

**The Problem**

Henry works for a Spark Plugs, a web design agency and some of their customers want them to setup web forms on their websites.

The demand for this feature has increased lately so they are trying to optimize and serve their customers in a faster way.

They have several in-house web designers but Eric, their only software developer is fully occupied with a project. As team lead, David made a request:

1. The web designers including Henry should start building forms for each customer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript such that when filled, data would be submitted to a specific API, a contracted software developer would build.

2. When contracted, the software developer would build a smart API that automatically creates databases per website, creates tables per form and inserts data to respective tables when the forms consume the APIs.

David plans to lease a MongoDB database server and .NET web server for the API. Henry has developed a simple HTML form and shared it here: https://github.com/Approovia-Limited/CodingChallenge-02-22/blob/master/customerform.html so the contracted software developer can use it to test.

**The Challenge**

We would like you to complete this task for Henry. Please build an API endpoint using C#, publish your code to a personal public repository on Github and share your repository link in reply to your challenge invite.

**The Rules**

1. Please use "localhost" as your MongoDB database server until David leases one for their company. To test the HTML form with your API endpoint, please modify the JavaScript variable, "endpoint" and the Content Security Policy 'script-src' values to your full endpoint URL.

2. As seen in the HTML form, your endpoint must return a JSON string with "success" as a Boolean to indicate if the form submission was successful and "message" to report feedback on the form submission status as a string. Henry spent time building this HTML file. Make it worth his while.

4. Adopt best practices for ensuring your code has the best quality. Your code shall be subject to a review for a score on quality. Visit [C# at Google Style Guide | styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/csharp-style.html) to learn more on David's expectations.

**Deadline**

You have till 3pm on Monday (21st February, 2022) to finish this task. Please proceed using the referenced sample HTML form here: https://github.com/Approovia-Limited/CodingChallenge-02-22/blob/master/customerform.html.

Good luck!
